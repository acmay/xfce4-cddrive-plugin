What is it?
===========

xfce4-cddrive-plugin puts a button in the XFCE panel which allow to open
or close a CD-ROM drive tray.
Additionally, the button icon reports the content of the drive.
The icon indicates if there is a disc in the drive, if it is mounted,
and the type of the disc (regular CD-ROM, audio or DVD).
You can also mount or unmount the disc via the plugin's menu (the action appears
when a disc is in the drive).


Requirements & limitations
==========================

- This plugin is based on HAL, and will not work if 'hald' is not running.

- This release only works correctly with Linux.

- The icons used to reports the content of the drive are the one of the theme
  currently in use (it becomes a limitation if your theme does not provide icons
  for cdrom drive and disc).
  
- The plugin can query the freedb.org servers for audio CD titles. To compile
  with this feature enabled, you need libcdio and libcddb. The gthread-2.0
  library is also recommanded in this case, but it is not mandatory.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions. For more
detailed information, visit the CD drive plugin website at
